"""This module contains code to diagnose problems with STASH requests, which
reference profile namelists using a shared name variable, since a
misconfiguration will result in failure of the model 

StashProfilesValidate checks for the following conditions:

 #1 There should be no time, domain or use profiles which share the
    same name

 #2 There should be no stash requests providing the name of a time,
    domain or use profile which hasn't been defined

 #3 If a time, domain or usage profile has been defined but isn't being
    included in any stash request (this is only a warning)

StashProfilesRemoveUnused removes the above namelists (those matched by #3)

The two classes share a parent class, StashProfiles, since they use the same
underlying method to extract a structure representing the configuration
