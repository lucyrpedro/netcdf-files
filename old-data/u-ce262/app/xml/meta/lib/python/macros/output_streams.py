"""This module contains code to diagnose problems with output stream
definitions and usage profiles, since a misconfiguration will result
in failure of the model or undesired output problems

It checks for the following conditions:

 #1 There should be no usage namelists attempting to send output data
    to an output stream which hasn't been defined

 #2 There cannot be multiple definitions with the same file_id

 #3 If an output stream has been defined but no output data is being
    sent there it might be a mistake (this is only a warning)
