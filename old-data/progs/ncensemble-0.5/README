What this does
--------------

"ncensemble" is a utility which will do point-wise ensemble statistics 
on sets of fields stored in netCDF files.

Basically, you have to have one input netCDF file per ensemble member, with
identical structure, and you get one netCDF file out (again with identical
structure) per type of statistic that you want to calculate, e.g. a file of
means a file of standard deviations etc.

It can be used just to calculate mean and standard deviation of a single
ensemble, but if you give it two ensembles (usually representing a
perturbation and a control experiment) then as well as giving ensemble mean
and standard deviations for each ensemble it can also evaluate the anomaly
(i.e. difference in means), and its associated t-statistic and one-tailed
probability value (lower tail).  As of version 0.4 it will also do maximum
and minimum of each ensemble.  Again, these are all point-by-point operations
within each field.  

Note that the standard deviations which it calculates are the form with
(n-1) in the denominator, i.e. the estimator of the population standard
deviation, (as opposed to the formulation of sample standard deviation with
"n" in the denominator).


Installation
------------

- Extract from the tar file (presumably you've done this already).

- Ensure you have netCDF headers and libraries installed.
  If not, get these first from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
 
- Type "make".  NB the makefile will try to find the netCDF installation by
  looking for "ncdump" in your executable search path, but if this doesn't
  work you can do "make NETCDF=....."

- Move the "ncensemble" executable to where you want it, or do "make install"
  for $HOME/bin (as non-root) or /usr/local/bin (as root).


Usage
-----

Here is a copy of the usage message that you can also see by running the
program without any arguments.

  Usage
  ncensemble <FLAGS> <INPUT FILES (ensemble 1)> [- <INPUT FILES (ensemble 2)>]

  Calculate fields of statistics for ensembles of NetCDF files.
  N.B. Requires input files to have identical structure.

  FLAGS include:

   one or more of the following:

     -m filename   output file for mean of ensemble 1
     -s filename   output file for s.d. of ensemble 1
     -M filename   output file for mean of ensemble 2
     -S filename   output file for s.d. of ensemble 2
     -a filename   output file for anomaly (ensemble 1 - ensemble 2)
     -t filename   output file for Student's t statistic on means
     -p filename   output file for one-tailed probability of t statistic

     -h filename   output file for maximum of ensemble 1
     -H filename   output file for maximum of ensemble 2
     -l filename   output file for minimum of ensemble 1
     -L filename   output file for minimum of ensemble 2

     (to remember the flags for max and min: h for highest, l for lowest)

   and optionally:

     -V  variables  comma-separated list of variables to process 
                    (defaults to all variables)

     -C  include also the coordinate variables related to the variables
         explicitly specified with -V (has no effect if -V is not used)

     -v  verbose
     -c  permit clobbering (overwriting) of existing output files

     -i  ignore mismatches in dims/vars between files [USE WITH CAUTION]

  FOR EXAMPLE:

    calculate mean and standard deviation for single ensemble:

        ncensemble -m mean.nc -s sd.nc \
            member1.nc member2.nc member3.nc member4.nc

    calculate anomaly and probability for two ensembles, writing only
     the variables "temp", "ps" and related coordinate variables to 
     output file (and allowing output to overwrite existing files):

        ncensemble -c -a anom.nc -p prob.nc -V temp,ps -C \
           pert1.nc pert2.nc pert3.nc pert4.nc - ctl1.nc ctl2.nc ctl3.nc

        (NB mnemonic: think of the dash on the command line separating the
         two ensembles as ensemble1 'minus' ensemble2.  This will give the)
         correct sense for the anomaly.)
