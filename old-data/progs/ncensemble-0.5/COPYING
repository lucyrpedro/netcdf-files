These routines are copyright the Science and Technology Facilities Council
(STFC), author Alan Iwi <A.M.Iwi@rl.ac.uk>, except for the file "tprob.c",
which contains a routine for calculating probability values for the Student's
t distribution and which is copyright the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and
STFC.

The RSS has given its permission for distribution of its routine, provided
that no fee is charged.  This routine cannot be distributed under the GNU GPL,
because the GPL does not allow the imposition of a "no fee" condition.  In
order to respect the "no fee" terms of their licence, but to allow for the
possibility of replacing their code in future with a GPL-compatible routine
and then distributing the whole program under the GPL, the whole program is
currently released under the following terms.

  (1) You are free to use and/or to modify this code, but in doing so you
      agree to hold STFC and its employees harmless against any claims
      arising from your use or modification of this software, however caused.

  (2) You are also free to copy and distribute this code, in accordance with
      your choice of clause (3) or clause (4) below.

  (3) You may distribute modified or unmodified versions, provided that:
       (a) you must not charge any fee, and
       (b) if you distribute any compiled code, you must include with it the
           corresponding source code, and
       (c) the whole must remain subject to this licence; you may not add to
           or remove anything from it, including freedoms or restrictions; you
           must include this COPYING file verbatim (except to add mention of
           any additional copyright holders in the first paragraph)

  (4) Alternatively, you may distribute modified or unmodified versions,
      provided that:
       (a) you entirely remove or replace the material which is copyright 
           the RSS, and
       (b) you distribute the remainder (with or without other modifications)
           under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 or later version,
           replacing this COPYING file with the text of the GPL, as normally
           displayed at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt
